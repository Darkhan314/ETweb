			Bacteria and viruses
		</h2>
		<p class="main_p">Virus (lat. Virus - poison) is a non-cellular infectious agent that can be reproduced only inside living cells. Viruses infect all types of organisms, from plants and animals to bacteria and archaea.(bacteria viruses are commonly called bacteriophages). Viruses capable of replicating only in the presence of other viruses (satellite viruses) have also been detected. <br><br>

				<h2>Influenza</h2>
				<h3>Acute respiratory tract infection caused by influenza virus.</h3>
				<p>Included in the group of acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI). Periodically distributed in the form of epidemics.<br>
				In most people, flu symptoms disappear within a week without medical attention. But flu can lead to serious illness and death, especially in people at risk. According to WHO estimates, annual influenza epidemics lead to 3-5 million cases of serious illness and 290-650 thousand deaths. The reconvalescence period is 7-15 days.<br>
				High-risk groups are children, the elderly, pregnant women, people with chronic heart disease, lungs.<br>
				Influenza epidemics and pandemics are caused by influenza serotype A viruses. Rarely (once every 4-6 years) the epidemic is also caused by influenza virus type “B”, they develop slowly compared to those caused by the virus “A” and, as a rule, cover 8-10% of the population.

				<h2>Varicella</h2>
				<h3>is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus</h3>
				<p>The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over.It usually starts on the chest, back, and face. It then spreads to the rest of the body. <br><br>
				Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches.Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections. The disease is often more severe in adults than in children. Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus.Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters.The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs.</p>

				<h2>Measles </h2>
				<h3>is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by measles virus.</h3>
				<p>Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Common complications include diarrhea (in 8% of cases), middle ear infection (7%), and pneumonia (6%). These occur in part due to measles-induced immunosuppression.<br><br>
				easles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It may also be spread through direct contact with mouth or nasal secretions. It is extremely contagious–nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will be infected. People are infectious to others from four days before to four days after the start of the rash. Most people do not get the disease more than once. Testing for the measles virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts.</p>

				<h2>Rubella</h2>
				<h3>also known as German measles or three-day measles, is an infection caused by the rubella virus.</h3>
				<p>This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are infected. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common.<br><br>
				Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.
				Rubella is usually spread through the air via coughs of people who are infected. People are infectious during the week before and after the appearance of the rash. Babies with CRS may spread the virus for more than a year.</p>

				<h2>Infectious mononucleosis</h2>
				<h3>also known as glandular fever, is an infection usually caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV).</h3>
				<p>Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and tiredness. Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen, and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur. <br><br>
				While usually caused by Epstein–Barr virus, also known as human herpesvirus 4, which is a member of the herpes virus family, a few other viruses may also cause the disease. It is primarily spread through saliva but can rarely be spread through semen or blood. Spread may occur by objects such as drinking glasses or toothbrushes or through a cough or sneeze. Those who are infected can spread the disease weeks before symptoms develop. Mono is primarily diagnosed based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with blood tests for specific antibodies. Another typical finding is increased blood lymphocytes of which more than 10% are atypical.</p>
